# Race01 Election - Welcome Back!

Marvel game about the real Ukrainian SuperHeroes

## Description

Election is a simple (enough) card game, goal of which is to overcome your opponent and not lose your own life.

To play the Election you have to get Election Account (does not really force you to vote, but who knows ʘ‿ʘ)

Once you register or login into your profile, you can start fighting with your friend (｡◕‿◕｡) or enemy( ఠൠఠ )ﾉ (no bots! do not forget about a real peoplpe, ok?)

The next issue is a process of game. When your friend enters a game, you both are able to deal your own cards (press active button 'DEAL CARDS')
'First come, first go'? Exactly. One of you who connected first will attack first. 

Let the fight begin!! 

Ough, every player receives one (1) player card and three (3) subject cards that could help him to get win.

In each round you can use only one subject card, so think carefuly and do not lose you chance to kick your opponent a*s ʕʘ̅͜ʘ̅ʔ
